# Affective Reactivity Index  
Information on the Affective Reactivity Index
**Affective Reactivity Index (ARI)**  
General Information  
On this page you can find the parent- and self-report ARI scales and a paper reporting on its psychometrics:  
•	English ARI-p (parent, see ari repo)   
•	English ARI-s (self, see ari repo)   
•	Stringaris et al 2012. The affective reactivity index: a concise irritability scale for clinical and research settings  
The ARI is also available in various translations: please see below.  
The ARI scales have been designed with busy clinicians and large studies in mind and are, therefore, concise. The individual items are scored 0,1, 2, and only the first six items are summed to form the total score--the seventh is an impairment item and it is analysed separately. There are a number of possibilities in terms of cut off. The easiest may be to divide the sum of the first six items by 6, by which you obtain a three-point scale corresponding to a three-level gradation of irritability severity. Another way is to use the following cut offs derived from a recent publication:  
ARI Parent-Report: At a cutpoint of >3 , the ARI Parent-Report correctly classified 92.6% of the sample of children with DMDD (n = 120) and healthy comparison youth (n = 110), with a sensitivity of 89.2 and a specificity of 96.4%.  
ARI Child-Report: At a cutpoint of >2 , the ARI Child-Report correctly classified 80.3% of the sample of children with DMDD (n = 122) and healthy comparison youth (n = 111), with a sensitivity of 83.6 and a specificity of 76.6%.  
The scale and its translations are free to use, however, they are under copyright and should not be altered in any way without our written permission (Dr Stringaris is the contact person).  
Please note that this is the six-month version of the ARI. We also have a one-week version (to assess change, with treatment studies in mind). We are working on its validation but know that it is reliable, and the American Psychiatric Association are using it already. We are happy to share this with you too.

**GitHub Repository of All Publications Citing the ARI (we have not updated this for a while)**   
Please find this GitHub repository (https://github.com/nimh-comppsych/ARI-Papers) to see all publications using the ARI. The publications are broken out into three primary categories: psychometric, observational, and treatment. This repository includes each publication’s title, the authors, the publication journal, the year of publication, the DOI associated with the publication, the abstract, and the use of the ARI.
